# Code generator

SyncBoot provides a powerful code generator, which allows front-end and back-end code to be generated with one click, realizing low-code development. It supports single table, tree list, one-to-many, one-to-one and other data models, and generates add, delete, modify and query functions with one click, and uses menu configuration directly.

It also provides a powerful template mechanism and supports custom templates. Currently, it provides four sets of style templates (two sets for single table, one set for tree model, and three sets for one-to-many)
