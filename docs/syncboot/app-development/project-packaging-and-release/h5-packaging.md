#### Package as H5

In the HBuilderX toolbar, as shown below:  
Here we are packaging into H5 process, so we choose the website-H5 mobile version option

Website title should not be empty  
![](https://lfs.k.topthink.com/lfs/f50a576ca13afb9430e96f314ab7db290f2edad09f235d741be1513e183ccdb8.dat)  
Here we can fill in the website title and the requested domain name. By default, it points to the root directory of the server.  
For example, if your domain name is [www.test.com, then its resource path is www.test.com/static/xxx. file suffix name, then your static file should be placed in the root directory of the server](http://www.test.com%EF%BC%8C%E9%82%A3%E4%BB%96%E7%9A%84%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%E8%B7%AF%E5%BE%84%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%C2%A0%C2%A0www.test.com/static/xxx.%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%E5%90%8E%E7%BC%80%E5%90%8D%E5%AD%97%EF%BC%8C%E9%82%A3%E4%BD%A0%E7%9A%84static%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%E5%B0%B1%E8%A6%81%E6%94%BE%E5%9C%A8%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8%E7%9A%84%E6%A0%B9%E7%9B%AE%E5%BD%95%E4%B8%8B%E9%9D%A2) , but this is not conducive to file management. At this time, we have to choose advanced to configure H5  
.

![](https://upload.jeecg.com/jeecg/help/jeecgback/images/screenshot_1591357948838.png)  
For example, if you create a file called [www.test.com/h5](http://www.test.com/h5%C2%A0) in the root directory of the server , then add /h5 to the running path .  
In this way, the running path of the resource is [www.test.com/h5/xxx. The file extension name](http://www.test.com/h5/xxx.%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%E5%90%8E%E7%BC%80%E5%90%8D%EF%BC%8C%E5%9C%A8%E6%A0%B9%E7%9B%AE%E5%BD%95%E5%88%9B%E5%BB%BA%E5%A4%9A%E5%B0%91%E7%BA%A7) corresponds to the number of levels created in the root directory  
. Then we click Publish again and we will get two folders  
:

Just put this in the corresponding folder of the server, and then access the corresponding index.html on the server to get the H5 page.
