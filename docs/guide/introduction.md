## What is VuePress

VuePress is a Vue-based static website generator, originally created to support the documentation needs of Vue and its sub-projects.

Each page generated by VuePress has pre-rendered HTML, which has very good loading performance and search engine optimization (SEO). At the same time, once the page is loaded, Vue will take over these static contents and convert them into a complete single-page application (SPA). Other pages will only be loaded on demand when the user browses to them.

## VuePress 2.0

VuePress 2.0 is a rewritten version using Vue 3, Vite, and TypeScript, providing better performance and development experience.

Major changes include:

- Use Vue 3 as the client-side framework
- Use Vite as a build tool
- Use TypeScript to build and provide type definitions
- Migrate to CSS variables to better support theme customization
- Improved plugin API
- Better Markdown support
- Minimal website structure and component library

## Core Concepts

Before you get into VuePress, it's necessary to understand its core concepts:

### Page

Each Markdown file in VuePress will be treated as an independent page. The relative path of the file will determine the routing path of the page.

### Configuration

The configuration file of the VuePress site is `.vuepress/config.js`, which exports a JavaScript object. You can define the site's title, description, theme configuration, etc. here.

### theme

The VuePress theme determines the look and functionality of your site. The default theme provides a beautiful documentation layout, but you can also develop custom themes or use community themes.

### Plugins

VuePress plugins can extend the functionality of your site, such as adding Google Analytics, PWA support, and more.
