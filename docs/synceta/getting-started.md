# Quick Start

This guide will help you build a simple VuePress website from scratch. If you already have an existing project and want to integrate VuePress into it, please go to the [guide](./README.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16.0.0 or higher
- A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

::: tip
In the following instructions, we will use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as an example of a package manager. You can use your favorite package manager and change the commands accordingly.
:::

## Install

The following steps will help you install this template and start using it:

### Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vuepress-template.git my-docs
cd my-docs
```

### Installation dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start the development server

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

The VuePress development server will start at `localhost:8080`.

## Project Structure

After a successful installation, your project should have the following structure:

```
.
├── docs
│ ├── .vuepress
│ │ ├── public #Static resource directory
│ │ └── config.js # Configuration file
│ ├── guide # Guide Directory
│ │ ├── README.md # Home page
│   │   ├── introduction.md
│   │   └── getting-started.md
│ └── README.md # Home page
└── package.json # Project dependencies
```

## Basic Configuration

The configuration file of VuePress is `.vuepress/config.js`. The following is a basic configuration example:

```js
import { defaultTheme } from "@vuepress/theme-default"
import { defineUserConfig } from "vuepress"

export default defineUserConfig({
  // Site configuration
  Language: "kr-CN",
  title: "My Documentation Site",
  description: "This is my first VuePress site",

  // Theme configuration
  theme: defaultTheme({
    logo: "/images/logo.png",
    navbar: [
      { text: "Home", link: "/" },
      { text: "Guide", link: "/synceta/" },
    ],
    sidebar: {
      "/guide/": [
        {
          text: "Guide",
          children: ["/synceta/README.md", "/synceta/introduction.md", "/synceta/getting-started.md"],
        },
      ],
    },
  }),
})
```

## Content Writing

VuePress is Markdown-centric, and all content is generated by Markdown files. Here is an example page:

````md
---
title: My first article
---

# My first post

VuePress uses Markdown enhanced syntax to provide many useful features.

## Code Block

```js
console.log("Hello, VuePress!")
```
````

## Prompt Container

## Deployment

To deploy your VuePress site, build the static files first:

```bash
pnpm docs:build
````

After the build is complete, static files will be generated in the `docs/.vuepress/dist` directory. You can deploy these files to any static website hosting service, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify or Vercel.

### Automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions

This template provides a pre-built GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically builds and deploys documentation to GitHub Pages when you push code to your main branch (e.g. `main`).

To make this work, you need:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your GitHub repository settings**: Go to your repository's "Settings" -> "Pages".
2. **Select the deployment source**: Select "GitHub Actions".

After that, every time you push to the master branch, GitHub Actions will automatically run the `deploy.yml` workflow to complete the build and deployment.

You can view the status of your workflow in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

::: tip
If you need to deploy to a custom domain name, please create a file named `CNAME` in the `.vuepress/public` directory and write your domain name into it.
